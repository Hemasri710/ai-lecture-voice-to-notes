Students often face difficulty in taking notes during lectures as it is challenging to listen and write simultaneously. Important points may be missed, leading to ineffective learning. This project proposes an AI-based Lecture Voice-to-Notes Generator that converts lecture audio into text using speech-to-text technology. The generated text is then summarized using generative AI to produce clear and concise study notes. Additionally, the system automatically generates quiz questions to help students evaluate their understanding. The application is developed using Python and Streamlit.
